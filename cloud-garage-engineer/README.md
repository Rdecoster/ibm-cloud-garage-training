# Cloud Native Engineer Bootcamp

## Computer Setup (Before Class)

In order to complete the course, you need several pieces of software installed.

**Mac is better than Windows for Cloud Garage Development**

If you have the choice, get a Mac. It will greatly simplify your life. It should take about 30m to install everything on your Mac.

If you have Windows, you must use WSL. It will take several hours to install WSL plus the required libraries on your Windows machine.

Please plan for this and set up your machines _before_ class.
